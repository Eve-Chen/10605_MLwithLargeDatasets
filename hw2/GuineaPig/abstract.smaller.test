believed in accepting the will of the majority hence his participation in jordanian politics following the jericho conference of 1948 he believed that holding fast to ones principles does not preclude one from dialogue with the other hence his reputation for openness and accessibility he always maintained that the jews as semites were arabs and had all the rights due to arabs throughout the arab world before 1947 several jewish lawyers took their articles in his offices this belief led to his support for a single state solution for palestine in 1939 his opposition to the fascist dogmas in europe in the 1930s and later as postulated by the baath movement when invited to become a founding member by michel aflaq he declined in a telegram with a single line of i have always opposed nazism he also opposed the expelling of jews from arab states post 1947nuseibeh was born in jerusalem he was the first palestinian arab to be sent to an english public school when he was sent to perse in cambridgeshire he then went to queens college cambridge where he studied law he was a keen sportsman who captained the cambridge tennis team an accomplished horseman and a talented pianist after cambridge he went on to grays inn where he was called to the barhe worked for the british administration of palestine first as land officer then as magistrate in nazareth then jaffa at the same time he worked with his father in law yacoub bey alghussein in the anti british nationalist movement often helping in clandestine operations to source weapons for the palestinian nationalist rebels in 1939 he supported the malcolm macdonald white paper which essentially called for the creation of a single democratic state for all citizens in palestine irrespective of race this was rejected by the zionist movement in 1945 he went to london at the behest of abd alrahman pasha azzam the well known egyptian statesman who was a friend of yacoub bey and founder of the arab league to head the arab office there this was seen as a counter move to the muftis move to berlinin 1947 he was appointed secretary to the arab national committee and was responsible for coordinating the defence of jerusalem when the hostilities broke out in 1948 his band of gentleman volunteers and their followers gave a good showing for themselves notably abd alrahman bey darwish who held up the israeli advance on the old city in the final stages of the war with a single company but were inevitably beaten by the more professional israeli forces during the final stages of the 1948 palestine war mr nuseibeh had his leg amputated after being ambushed by israeli forces on his return with his convoy from a failed mission to convince king abdullah then at shuna in jordan to lend a single piece of artillery to hold the valley approach to jerusalem against the advance by israeli militias after a brief period recuperating in beirut he returned to palestine to become secretary to the cabinet of the government of all palestine in gaza after 1948 he led the arab delegation to discuss the terms of the armistice and the cease fire line with the newly founded israeli government he originally opposed the jericho conference favoured by his brother hazem in 1948 but accepted the will of the majority and returned to jerusalem to serve in the jordanian governmenthe held a number of cabinet posts in the jordanian government including defence interior and education and stood for parliament as well as serving in the senate by the late 1950s he had moved away from the government in amman as he gave up on convincing the young king hussein to accept parliamentary democracy in 1961 he became governor of jerusalem but was dismissed after he refused to allow a us senator to cross the mandelbaum check point from israel into jerusalem on the basis that such an act would be a de facto admission that the border was legal as opposed to simply a cease fire line he was dismissed by the king which led to riots in jerusalem in his support in 1965 he became the jordanian ambassador to the court of st james during his time as an ambassador in london nuseibeh established a warm relationship with members of the british royal familyhe returned to jerusalem just before the 1967 war technically abandoning his post and continued to live there under occupation in 1970 he fell out with the plo because he thought their war with the jordanian authorities was ill conceived and dishonorable since they were effectively guests in jordan in 1974 he moved further from the palestinian nationalist cause when he opposed the rabat conference for two reasons first he believed that king hussein and president nasser had a moral duty to the palestinians to restore the 1967 borders because it was lost on their watch secondly he believed that making the plo the sole representative of the palestinian people was merely a precursor to their accepting the legality of the state of israel which he never did that is why he was adamant that the first step was always un resolution 242 then a discussion of democratic principles as the only moral solution to the problem he always held the view that his implacable refusal to accept the legality of the state of israel did not preclude conversation with a people he viewed as fellow arabs with a different religion and so became one of the first palestinians involved in contacts with israel after it captured the arab sector of the city his final act of public service was taking on the post of chairman of the east jerusalem electric company which had become the center for a tug of war over the legality of israeli occupation of east jerusalem it is notable that at the death of this essentially patrician arab his large funeral was led by the socialist labour unionsduring his life he filled the following positionsland officer of jerusalem 1936magistrate nazareth then jafahead of arab offices london 1945secretary to the arab national committee 194748

Geothermal_heat_pump	other	a geothermal heat pump or ground source heat pump gshp is a central heating andor cooling system that transfers heat to or from the groundit uses the earth as a heat source in the winter or a heat sink in the summer this design takes advantage of the moderate temperatures in the ground to boost efficiency and reduce the operational costs of heating and cooling systems and may be combined with solar heating to form a geosolar system with even greater efficiency ground source heat pumps are also known as geothermal heat pumps although strictly the heat does not come primarily from the centre of the earth but from the sun they are also known by other names including geoexchange earthcoupled earth energy systems the engineering and scientific communities prefer the terms geoexchange or ground source heat pumps to avoid confusion with traditional geothermal power which uses a high temperature heat source to generate electricity ground source heat pumps harvest heat absorbed at the earths surface from solar energy the temperature in the ground below 6 metres 20 ft is roughly equal to the mean annual air temperature at that latitude at the surfacedepending on latitude the temperature beneath the upper 6 metres 20 ft of earths surface maintains a nearly constant temperature between 10 and 16 c 50 and 60 f if the temperature is undisturbed by the presence of a heat pump like a refrigerator or air conditioner these systems use a heat pump to force the transfer of heat from the ground heat pumps can transfer heat from a cool space to a warm space against the natural direction of flow or they can enhance the natural flow of heat from a warm area to a cool one the core of the heat pump is a loop of refrigerant pumped through a vaporcompression refrigeration cycle that moves heat airsource heat pumps are typically more efficient at heating than pure electric heaters even when extracting heat from cold winter air although efficiencies begin dropping significantly as outside air temperatures drop below 5 c 41 f a ground source heat pump exchanges heat with the ground this is much more energyefficient because underground temperatures are more stable than air temperatures through the year seasonal variations drop off with depth and disappear below 7 metres 23 ft to 12 metres 39 ft due to thermal inertia like a cave the shallow ground temperature is warmer than the air above during the winter and cooler than the air in the summer a ground source heat pump extracts ground heat in the winter for heating and transfers heat back into the ground in the summer for cooling some systems are designed to operate in one mode only heating or cooling depending on climategeothermal pump systems reach fairly high coefficient of performance cop 3 to 6 on the coldest of winter nights compared to 17525 for airsource heat pumps on cool days ground source heat pumps gshps are among the most energy efficient technologies for providing hvac and water heatingsetup costs are higher than for conventional systems but the difference is usually returned in energy savings in 3 to 10 years and even shorter lengths of time with federal state and utility tax credits and incentives geothermal heat pump systems are reasonably warranted by manufacturers and their working life is estimated at 25 years for inside components and 50 years for the ground loop as of 2004 there are over a million units installed worldwide providing 12 gw of thermal capacity with an annual growth rate of 10
